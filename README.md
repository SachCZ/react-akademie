## Usage
This is the usage of the develeopment enviroment not the app itself.  

First you need to get the server and app running on your machine.
You can do that using yarn or npm by following the instructions bellow.
Then you can simply make changes to the files in src directory and they will be
reflected in real time to the app.

### npm

Open a terminal window, go to the project root where package.json resides and run:


```
    npm run server
```

This will initiate a json-server listening on port :3003 of localhost.
That is the raw data will be available under: [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003).

Then open **another** terminal window go to the project root directory and run:

```
    npm run start
```
This will initiate the app listening on port :3000 of localhost.
The app will then be available under [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### yarn

Open a terminal window, go to the project root where package.json resides and run:


```
    yarn run server
```

This will initiate a json-server listening on port :3003 of localhost.
That is the raw data will be available under: [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003).

Then open **another** terminal window go to the project root directory and run:

```
    yarn run start
```
This will initiate the app listening on port :3000 of localhost.
The app will then be available under [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
